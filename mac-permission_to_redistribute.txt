Hi Orcan,

Here's the license:
http://www.monkeysaudio.com/license.html

Like I said, my intent is to make the code free without restrictions and 
complications.  Per the language of the license, consider this "express 
written consent" to do as you like.

I'm not too interested in getting into a horse-trading arrangement to 
give code away.  I hope you understand.

Best,
-Matt
